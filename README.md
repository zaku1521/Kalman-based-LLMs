Kalman-based Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimisation Algorithm to Enhance GPT in LLMs for Medical Sentiment Analysis of Patient Health-related Feedback

Figure: Variation of bias situation of MLP model during training. (a) represents the change in training bias of MLP model under optimiser Adam, and (b) represents the change in training bias of MLP model under the proposed KAdam-EnGPT4LLM.

Figure: The trend graph of AUC values for different models. (a), (b), (c), and (d) illustrate the AUC value trends for GRU, LSTM, RNN+Attention, and TextCNN models under both the proposed KAdam-EnGPT4LLM and the classic Adam optimization algorithms.
